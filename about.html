      <h3>The Founder</h3>
      <p><strong>Keaton Ghall</strong> is a growth strategist with more than a decade of experience working with companies across the UK, Europe, and the US. After years of helping agencies and enterprises optimize their digital presence and sales pipelines, Keaton saw a gap in how many South African businesses approached digital marketing. Too often it was reactive, disconnected, or built on outdated playbooks.</p>
      <p>He started RevHaus with a simple conviction:</p>
      <blockquote>“If we can help local and global brands speak with clarity, strategy, and confidence in the digital space, we can help them grow sustainably.”</blockquote>
      <p>RevHaus was born out of that vision to merge strategy and execution under one roof and to empower businesses to thrive in an evolving digital economy.</p>
